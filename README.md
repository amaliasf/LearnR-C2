# LearnR-C2

In learning R language in the classroom, there is a lot of material presented and it is possible for students to miss important points that should be known. So we need a platform that makes it easy for students to review material that meets academy standards. This LearnR is an alternative that is expected to build adequate understanding for students. LearnR is interactive tutorials for learning R.
